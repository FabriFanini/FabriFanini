## About me

I hold a **Bachelor's degree in Business Administration** with a strong passion for programming and technology. Currently, I am deeply engaged in the exciting world of **blockchain development**, pursuing a master's degree at [ConquerBlocks](https://conquerblocks.com) under the guidance of top-tier professionals.

Throughout my budding programming career, I have collaborated on various projects, including:
- A **[weather application](https://github.com/FabriFanini/wheater-app)** developed alongside other programmers.  
- Joint projects with a **UX designer**, where I was responsible for implementing the **front-end** of her work, [Travel Beyond](https://github.com/FabriFanini/travel-beyond).  
- **Personal projects** designed to practice like [wordy master](https://github.com/FabriFanini/wordy-masters).

I consider myself a lifelong learner, always striving to stay updated with the latest trends and eager to grow in this vast and dynamic field of programming and blockchain.
Passionate about building innovative projects that connect technology and business. Experienced in administration and developing digital strategies.
